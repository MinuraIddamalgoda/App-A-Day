# App-A-Day
Basically, my plan is to understand a new concept of mobile app development every day or refine my current
skills. I was inspired by https://jenniferdewalt.com/ who made a website a day for 180 days, I will attempt to make some sort of mobile app a day for 180 days

# Day One -- ScrollViews (iOS)
So this was a relatively rough app, for sure need to manage my time better with these projects. The app consists of three hardcoded images that the user can horizontally scroll through. I've also added two smaller images on the bottom left and bottom right of the screen and attached TapGestureRecognizers to them so they programmatically scroll the images. 

In all, it wasn't too bad. The code could be cleaner and more modular, but there's plenty of internal documentation should a newbie happen across this project.
